"""
    This directory contains unit tests.
    These tests are designed to run with `pytest`.
    Just run `pytest` (or `python -m pytest`) in the root directory to run all tests.
    To run individual tests, give the filename (e.g., `pytest tests/test_doc.py`).
    This assumes `pytest` is installed (`pip install pytest` or `conda install pytest`).
