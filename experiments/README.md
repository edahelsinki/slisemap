# Experiments

This directory contains the experiments for the Slipmap paper. The scripts also produce the plots and tables in the paper. Running all experiments sequentially would take hundreds of hours, but cached results from the experiments are included in this branch. The results can also be seen in the paper:

> *Björklund, A., Seppäläinen, L., & Puolamäki, K. (2024).*  
> **SLIPMAP: Fast and Robust Manifold Visualisation for Explainable AI**
