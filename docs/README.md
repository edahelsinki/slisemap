# Docs

This directory contains the files needed for building the documentation with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org).

This is used for the [documentation](https://edahelsinki.github.io/slisemap) (that is automatically built when a new release is created on GitHub).

To build the documentation locally, just install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` and run `make html` in this directory.
