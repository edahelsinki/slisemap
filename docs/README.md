# Docs

This directory contains the files needed for building the documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

This is used for the [documentation](https://edahelsinki.github.io/slisemap) (that is automatically built when a new release is created on GitHub).

To browse the documentation locally, just install the dependencies in `requirements-dev.txt` and run `mkdocs serve` in this directory.
